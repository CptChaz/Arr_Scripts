# Arr_Scripts
Scripts related to any of the *arr applications, written with chatgpt assistance. These scripts are developed in the linuxserver containers. Some random ideas for niche use cases, and others commonly and broadly applicable. If i have a need or an idea for a script that i havent seen somewhere else on the interwebs, i try to throw it together and archive it here for anyone.

Some scripts have been tested, some have not. I'll try to mark any scripts that i haven't tested as "untested" in the status description. if you test an untested script, feel free to put in a PR.
